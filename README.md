A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


# SEMALEX 0.1.0
## Overview
SEMALEX is a cutting-edge RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Evaluation Metric designed to measure the weighted similarity score by prioritizing semantic capture while also considering lexical alignment. This metric leverages advanced NLP techniques to evaluate the quality of generated text in comparison to reference text.

## Features
**Advanced Semantic Similarity Measurement**: Leverages state-of-the-art ```Sentence Transformers``` to precisely capture and measure the semantic similarity between reference and generated text, ensuring nuanced understanding and alignment.

**Comprehensive Lexical Alignment Analysis**: Employs sophisticated ```TF-IDF(Term frequency-Inverse document frequency)``` techniques to analyze and quantify keyword overlap, providing detailed insights into lexical consistency and term relevance.

**Integrated Weighted Scoring Mechanism**: Delivers a holistic evaluation by combining ```semantic similarity``` with ```lexical alignment``` through a ```weighted scoring system```, balancing the importance of semantic capture and keyword matching for a robust and insightful assessment.
## Installation
You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install SEMALEX
```
## Usage
Here's how to use the SEMALEX Package:
```bash
from rag-evaluator import EnhancedEvaluator

# Initialize the evaluator
evaluator = EnhancedEvaluator()

# Input data
reference_text = "Human activities such as burning fossil fuels cause climate change."
generated_text = "There is a huge impact of human activities on climate. Some of these activities are burning fossil fuels, mining and so on."

# Evaluate the response
metrics = evaluator.evaluate_all(reference_text, generated_text)

# Print the results
print(f"Final Score (SemaLex): {metrics['SemaLex']}")
```
## Key Components

- **`EnhancedEvaluator` Class:**  
  The cornerstone of **SemaLex**, this class integrates advanced techniques for evaluating semantic similarity and lexical alignment, providing a unified framework for comprehensive text analysis.

- **`evaluate_semantic_similarity` Method:** 
  Utilizes cosine similarity on semantic embeddings from ```Sentence Transformers``` to assess the degree of alignment between the reference and generated texts, delivering precise semantic similarity metrics.

- **`tokenize_text` Method:**  
  Employs the ```GPT-2 tokenizer``` to transform text into tokens, facilitating accurate and consistent text processing for subsequent analysis.

- **`compute_tfidf` Method:**  
  Calculates ```TF-IDF``` scores to quantify keyword relevance and distribution, enabling detailed lexical analysis and comparison.

- **`compare_keywords` Method:**  
  Analyzes and measures the overlap of ```top keywords``` between reference and generated texts, providing insights into lexical alignment and term consistency.Top keywords are selected on the basis of their TF-IDF scores thus ensuring to capture all significant words(tokens) in the texts.

- **`evaluate_all` Method:**  
  Synthesizes the results from semantic similarity and keyword overlap analyses into a final weighted score, balancing the contributions of both metrics for a holistic evaluation.

## Significance of Weighted Score

The **weighted score** in **SemaLex** represents a refined balance between semantic and lexical evaluation, encapsulating a comprehensive measure of textual similarity. This score is computed using the formula:

```python
weighted_score = (0.3 * keyword_overlap_score + 0.7 * semantic_similarity)
```


### **Semantic and Lexical Balance**

- **```Semantic Similarity (70% Weight)```:**  
  The weighted score allocates a significant 70% emphasis to semantic similarity, highlighting the importance of understanding and aligning the core meaning of the text. By employing advanced Sentence Transformers, this component focuses on the deep ```contextual relationships``` between the reference and generated texts. This approach ensures that the evaluation captures the true essence and coherence of the content, going beyond mere surface-level word matching to reflect genuine semantic alignment and contextual relevance.

- **```Lexical Alignment (30% Weight)```:**  
  Contributing 30% to the overall score, lexical alignment evaluates keyword overlap through sophisticated TF-IDF analysis. This component assesses the ```textual fidelity``` and ```consistency``` by analyzing the occurrence and relevance of specific terms between the texts. While it plays a secondary role to semantic similarity, lexical alignment is crucial for capturing the importance of terminology and its accurate representation, adding an essential layer of precision to the evaluation of textual adherence and relevance.

### **Comprehensive Evaluation**

The strategic distribution of weights ensures that the final score provides a balanced and nuanced evaluation. By combining a predominant focus on ```semantic meaning``` with an essential consideration of ```lexical accuracy```, **SEMALEX** delivers a comprehensive metric that reflects both the depth of content understanding and the precision of term usage. This ```dual-focus``` approach allows for a well-rounded assessment of text similarity, capturing both the ```substantive quality``` of meaning and the detailed ```accuracy of terminology```.
